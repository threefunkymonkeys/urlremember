URL Remember
============

A simple service to remember/bookmark URLs. It is not a Delicious
clone, far from it, it's just that I always have plenty of open tabs
in different computers & browsers. But that's just a lame excuse, the
truth is that I wanted to start playing with Node.js and this was the
first idea that came up ;)

I'm planning to eventually add OAuth and some other stupid things, but
for the moment this is more than ok, at least for me.
